**Customer Segmentation Analysis**
Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer data from a retail mall to identify distinct customer segments. The analysis follows a standard data science pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and clustering techniques.

**Key Findings**
The analysis of the dataset revealed several key insights into customer behavior:

Data Quality: The dataset was very clean, with no duplicate rows and no missing values in the core numeric features.

Feature Relationships: A surprising finding was the lack of a linear relationship between a customer's Annual Income and their Spending Score.

Dimensionality Reduction: Visualizations using t-SNE proved to be highly effective at revealing clear customer groups. The plots showed several distinct "islands" of customers, a pattern not visible in the PCA plots.

Optimal Clusters: Both the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score analysis suggested that the optimal number of customer segments is k=5.

Customer Segments: The clustering analysis successfully identified five distinct customer groups based on their age, income, and spending habits. These clusters can be further profiled to understand their unique characteristics.
